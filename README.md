# Summary

The project generates multiple Nugets called 'Laerdal.McuMgr' & 'Laerdal.McuMgr.Bindings.iOS|Android|NetStandard' (note: NetStandard is still WIP).
The goal is to have 'Laerdal.McuMgr' provide an elegant high-level C# abstraction for the native device-managers that Nordic provides us with for
iOS and Android respectively to interact with [nRF5x series of BLE chips](https://embeddedcentric.com/nrf5x-soc-overview/):

- [IOS-nRF-Connect-Device-Manager](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-nRF-Connect-Device-Manager)

- [Android-nRF-Connect-Device-Manager](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Connect-Device-Manager)

From the respective 'Readme' files of these projects:

<< nRF Connect Device Manager library is compatible with [McuManager (McuMgr, for short)](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.2.0/services/device_mgmt/mcumgr.html#overview),
a management subsystem supported by [nRF Connect SDK](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/index.html),
[Zephyr](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.2.0/introduction/index.html) and Apache Mynewt.

**It is the recommended protocol for Device Firmware Update(s) on new Nordic-powered devices going forward and should not be confused with the previous protocol, NordicDFU,
serviced by the [Old DFU Library](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-DFU-Library)**.

McuManager uses the [Simple Management Protocol, or SMP](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.2.0/services/device_mgmt/smp_protocol.html), to send and receive message requests
from compatible devices. The SMP Transport definition for Bluetooth Low Energy, which this library implements,
[can be found here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/device_mgmt/smp_transport.html).

The library provides a transport agnostic implementation of the McuManager protocol. It contains a default implementation for BLE transport. >>

The following types of operations are supported on devices running on Nordic's nRF5x series of BLE chips:

- Upgrading the firmware
- Erasing one of the firmware images stored in the device
- Rebooting ('Resetting') the device
- Downloading one or more files from the device
- Uploading one or more files over to the device

      Note: The library doesn't support "Windows Desktop" applications (Windows/UWP) just yet (WIP).

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Salient Points

- **For the firmware-upgrade to actually persist through the rebooting of the device it's absolutely vital to set the upgrade mode to 'Test & Confirm'. If you set it to just 'Test' then the effects of the firmware-upgrade will only last up to the next reboot and the the device will revert back to its previous firmware image.**

- **Make sure to explicitly un-bond any app (including the NRF apps!) from the devices you are trying to upgrade. Any device in the vicinity that's still bonded will cause problems
in case you try to perform a firmware-upgrade on the desired device.**

- **Make sure to clean up after your apps when using the firmware-upgrader, device-resetter or firmware-eraser. Calling .Disconnect() is vital to avoid leaving behind latent connections
to the device.**

- **At the time of this writing the generated ios-nugets are built based on the iphoneos16.2 sdk**

- To perform file-uploading on the device:

         Note:

         The very first upload always feels slow and takes quite a bit of time to commence because Zephyr chipsets perform filesystem cleanup. There is nothing we can do about this.
         The culprit lies in issues plaguging littlefs

## üì± iOS

Same as in Android with the only difference being that the constructors change a bit:

```c#
_fileUploader = new Laerdal.McuMgr.FileUploader.FileUploader(desiredBluetoothDevice.CbPeripheral);
_firmwareEraser   = new Laerdal.McuMgr.FirmwareEraser.FirmwareEraser(desiredBluetoothDevice.CbPeripheral);
_firmwareUpgrader = new Laerdal.McuMgr.FirmwareInstaller.FirmwareInstaller(desiredBluetoothDevice.CbPeripheral);

_deviceResetter = new Laerdal.McuMgr.DeviceResetter.DeviceResetter(desiredBluetoothDevice.CbPeripheral);
```



## üíª Windows / UWP

Not supported yet.



## üèó IDE Setup / Generating Builds on Local-dev


    Note#1 There's an github-actions.yml file which you can use as a template to integrate the build in your github workflows. With said .yml the generated nugets will work on both Android and iOS.
_

    Note#2 To build full-blown nugets that work both on iOS and Android you must use MacOS as your build-machine with XCode 14.3+ and JDK17 installed - have a look at the .yml file to see how you
    can install java easily using 'brew'.

_

    Note#3 If you build on Windows the build system will work but the generated nugets *will only work on Android with MAUI apps* but they will error out on iOS considering that the 'iOS part'
           of the build gets skipped in Windows.

To build the nugets from source follow these instructions:

#### 1) Checkout

```bash
git   clone   git@github.com:Laerdal-Medical/scl-mcumgr.git    mcumgr.mst

# or for develop

git   clone   git@github.com:Laerdal-Medical/scl-mcumgr.git    --branch develop      mcumgr.dev
```

#### 2) Make sure you have .Net7 and .Net-Framework 4.8+ installed on your machine along with the workloads for maui, android and ios

```bash
# cd into the root folder of the repo
declare dotnet_7_workload_version="7.0.101"              \
&&                                                       \

# note#1   theoretically 'dotnet workload restore' on the root level should also do the trick but in practice it sometimes runs into problems
#
# note#2   microsoft encourages us to always update to and use the latest workloads   in practice devs have complained that they've
#          run into headaches with this approach and would rather pin versions explicitly as shown above   chances are you will have
#          one or more workloads forcibly updated to greater versions and if that's indeed the case then it's nearly impossible for
#          you to roll the workload versions back to the ones shown here   most probably your build system will still work and you won't
#          run into trouble   if you do you will either have to (a) reinstall .net7 from scratch or (b) use docker as your build system
#          to enforce strict workload-versioning on builds     
```

After running the above command running 'dotnet workload list' should print out something like this on Windows:

```bash
> dotnet workload list

#### 3) Make sure that Java17 is installed on your machine along with Gradle 7.6 (Gradle 8.x or above will NOT work!)

#### 4) Make sure you have installed Android SDKs starting from 31 up. You will need to install them using the Visual Studio installer. If you use Rider you will need to install them a second time using the Rider Android SDK manager too!   

#### 5) (optional) If you want to develop locally without pulling nugets from the feed make sure you add to your nuget sources the local filesystem-path to the folder 'Artifacts'

Same goes for the testbed-ui app. If you want to build it locally you'll have to add to nuget sources the local file-system path 'Artifacts'.

#### 6) Set MSBuild version to ver.17

#### 7) On Mac make sure to install XCode 14.3+ (if you have multiple XCodes installed then make SDK 14.3+ the default by running 'sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_XYZ.app/Contents/Developer').

#### 8) On Windows you have to also make sure you have enabled in the OS (registry) 'Long Path Support' otherwise the build will fail due to extremely long paths.

#### 9) Open 'Laerdal.McuMgr.sln' and build it.

You'll find the resulting nugets in the folder `Artifacts/`.

    Note: For software development you might want to consider bumping the version of Laerdal.McuMgr.Bindings.* first and building just that project
    and then bumping the package version of the package reference towards Laerdal.McuMgr.Bindings inside Laerdal.McuMgr.csproj and then building said project.

    If you don't follow these steps then any changes you make in Laerdal.McuMgr.Bindings.* won't be picked up by Laerdal.McuMgr because it will still
    use the cached nuget package of Laerdal.McuMgr.Bindings based on its current version.

    To make this process a bit easier you can use the following script at the top level directory (on branches other than 'main' or 'develop' to keep yourself on the safe side):

```bash
# on macos *sh
dotnet                                              \
         msbuild                                    \
         Laerdal.Builder.targets             \
         '"/m:1"'                                   \
         '"/p:Laerdal_Version_Full=1.0.x.0"'

# on windows powershell
& dotnet                                            ^
          msbuild                                   ^
          Laerdal.Builder.targets            ^
          '"/m:1"'                                  ^
          '"/p:Laerdal_Version_Full=1.0.x.0"'

# Note: Make sure to +1 the 'x' number each time in the aforementioned scripts before running them.
```

## Known issues

- Intercepting logs emitted by the underlying McuMgr libs is supported in iOS through the 'LogEmitted' family of events. 
  But the same family of events in Android is never triggered from the underlying McuMgr libs of Nordic (it's only triggered when we want to emit certain warnings ourselves) so logging
  in Android is very limited.

## Contributing
